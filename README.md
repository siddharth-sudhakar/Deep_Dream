# Deep_Dream
In this personal project, I have implemented the DeepDream algorithm using TensorFlow and the InceptionV3 model (using ImageNet weights), and the image shown in code is a sample image before and after putting it through the model. 

DeepDream is an AI algorithm that excites or overprocesses the outputs at specific neural network layers to create a "dream-like" appearance. Loosely translated, it simulates what humans go through after taking psychedelic substances.
